<div class="design-step-wrapper">
  <div class="design-step wide-wrapper">
    <div class="design-step--number">Step 1</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Understand</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Before anything else, I seek to learn and understand three things: </div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. The user</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Who is it that we’re serving with this design? What are their pain points?</p>
        <p>Validate the answer to these questions through customer research - directly talking to them. I’ve found phone calls to be the best method for validating at this stage. Surveys, when done well, can work well too.</p>
        <p>The goal here is to not only understand and validate the customer but also their points points. We want to ensure that they're truly a pain point and they're "painful" enough to be worth solving.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. The business objectives</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>How will success be deteremined and measured? What are the outcomes we would like to see from a business perspective?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">3. The competitive landscape</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Which of our competitors also offer this feature? How are others solving this same problem? How can we differentiate ourselves?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="design-step--number">Step 2</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Design</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Once we understand the fun can begin. I like to break this phase up into three steps:</div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. User journey mapping</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>This is a high level view of the step-by-step experience the customer will go through. When you think of the whole users experience - the end to end flow - this is it. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. Low-Fidelity Design</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>The idea here is to focus on visual heirarchy and is one of the most critical design steps. It helps flesh out which elements should be in the interface and are most important and how they relate to one another.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">3. High-Fidelity Design</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>I take the low-fidelity design and make it an actual design with colors and images and textures and patterns. Although the design is not done yet, it finally feels real and is very satisfying.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that we are still guessing at a design solution. We still need to validate which parts of this design work and, most importantly, which don’t.</p>

<div class="design-step-wrapper">
  <div class="design-step wide-wrapper">
    <div class="design-step--number">Step 3</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Test & Iterate</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Remember to use data in order to inform design changes. That’s what this step is all about:</div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. User testing the design </div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>It’s time to put the design in front of users. In my experience usability testing like this yeilds the most helpful information on the success of this design sprint.</p>
        <p>I typically run user tests in batches of 3-5 users. By then I will have identified where the usability problems are. I redesign the problem areas and re-test until we’re confident.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. Develop Designs</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Putting pixels to code.  Depending on my role, I’m not always the one doing it. I love this step, whether I’m the one writing the code or not. :)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">3. Validate Design Goals</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>In step one we identified goals that would determine success. Now it’s time to measure those goals. Typically this involves analytics software - hotjar, google analytics, kissmetrics, etc.</p>
        <p>It's important that a regularly scheduled meeting (I find monthly is a good time interval) is set to review the results and to determine actions that need to be taken. Typical actions are re-designing and re-test a certain aspects of the interface, measuring something we missed previously, and so on. I love that all actions are based in data not opinion.</p>
