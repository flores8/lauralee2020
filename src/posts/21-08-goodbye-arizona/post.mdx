# Goodbye Arizona

![Goodybe Arizona](./images/goodbye-arizona.jpg)

We have been in Arizona for the last 11 years. This month we will be leaving this wonderful state that has treated us so well.

We will also be leaving our home country and moving to a new continent and country and language and people.

We have made friendships that we will always cherish.

We have known people and had experiences that have fundamentally changed who we are for the better.

We feel incredibly thankful for those who have crossed our path and blessed our lives during our time here.

Shortly we will begin a new adventure in Switzerland for my husband’s work.

We feel deeply grateful for all the wonderful people and experiences we have known and had that have shaped the people we’ve become. We look forward to more people and experiences like this in Switzerland.

We will take them all with us in our hearts.
