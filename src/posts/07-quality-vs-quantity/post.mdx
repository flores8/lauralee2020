# Quality vs Quantity

I am trying to become better at the work I do.

It's more than that, actually. I'm seeking to become excellent.

In this pursuit I see two different ideas.

### Quality or quantity?

The first is the idea is that creating a lot of work leads to excellence.

This idea suggests that you simply put in your reps you'll become great.

The second idea is that quality is 100 times more important than quantity. It's not about doing something a bunch of times but on doing it perfectly.

There was an interesting study with pottery students that compared these two approaches.

One group of students were told for their assignment to create the perfect pot. Just one perfect pot. They would be graded on quality.

The other group of students were told to create as many pots as they could. They would be graded on quantity.

The outcome?

The group of students who were graded on quantity learned how to create great pots and hugely outperformed the perfect pot group in terms of quality.

So, is quantity the answer?

I don't think it's as simple as that.

Quantity matters. There is no doubt that is true.

This is especially true for someone new to something.

When you're first learning how to code, draw, paint, design, speak a new language, or any other new skill, the amount of time you spend practicing that new skill is huge.

For the seasoned software developer or professional painter putting in the same old reps doesn't have the same kind of results.

The better you are at something, the _quality_ of the reps begin to matter more and more.

With each rep you need to ask yourself if that is your best work? Could you do better?

One of my favorite quotes is by an artist named Stephen McCranie:

> “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”

He knows the power of putting in a large volume of work. Not every piece of work is going to be a masterpiece. Many of them will be failures.

Each rep should teach and sharpen your skill.

Quantity seems to win the argument between quantity vs quality. Because as we've seen **quantity leads to quality.**

However, as time goes on the same reps will become easier and easier. Those reps need to increase in difficulty, variety, and **quality**.

At the end of the day, if a thing is done really well, no one is going to ask how many came before it or even how long it took.

## Conclusion

So, for you and I who are trying to become better at the work we do. Which matters more? Quantity? Quality?

It's both. Together.

At first, quantity is more important.

As a skill is developed quantity still matters but quality becomes equally as important.

With each piece of work don't just put in your rep. **Make that rep your very best.** Increase the level of difficulty of the rep. Make subtle changes to the rep to stretch and broaden your abilities.
