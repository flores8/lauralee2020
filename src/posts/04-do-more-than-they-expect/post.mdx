# Do More Than They Expect

I love the work I do. I really, really love it. I wake up excited to express myself through my work. I feel like I’m doing the thing I was born to do.

That doesn’t mean that it is always easy and that I want to do it all the time. In fact, there are times when it is <Link to="/blog/why-i-seek-big-problems">incredibly difficult</Link> and even unpleasant.

I have my moments when I must just do the work. I must persevere. I’m not doing it because I love every minute of the process. I am doing it because I started it and I am going to love the outcome. I'm doing it <Link to="/blog/why-i-set-goals">to become</Link> the person I want to become. I am doing it to <Link to="/blog/why-i-seek-big-problems">change the world</Link>.

Don’t let that mistake you. I will do more than just try. I will do more than just go through the motions. And most importantly, I will do more than what is required or expected of me.

I will do and be my very best. I will try to over deliver in the time that I have.

And so should you.
