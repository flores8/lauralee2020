  <h6>My Design Process</h6>
  <h1>
    I am constantly learning and improving and changing. So, don't take this as the one and only way I have ever or will ever design. But, it is a good overview.
  </h1>

<div class="design-step-wrapper">
  <div class="design-step wide-wrapper">
    <div class="design-step--number">Step 1</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Understand</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Before anything else, I seek to learn and understand a few things: </div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. The user</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Who is it that we‚Äôre serving with this design? What are their pain points?</p>
        <p>The easiest design projects are those for myself. I know what I want and where my pain points are. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
        <p>It stands to reason then that I try to be very smart about the companies I work with. Do they serve people like me? The closer to the target audience is to myself the faster I can usually get to great insights and great designs.</p>
        <p>Does this mean I can only serve audiences that are just like me? Of course not. But I can get to a good design faster. And it wise to keep this in mind.</p>
        <p>Getting to know and understand an audience is so fundamentally important to serving that audience well, that this is easily the first step I need to take in order to create something extraordinary for them.</p>
        <p>Talking to them or talking to the people that interact with them regularly is where I would start.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. The business objectives</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>How will success be determined and measured?</p>
        <p>Sometimes speed is most important. Or rate of use, especially if we can compare before and after. Sometimes it's upgrades, signups, or something else.</p>
        <p>Before beginning I like to know where we're trying to go from a business perspective.</p>

    <div class="design-step--number">Step 2</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Design</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Once we understand, the fun can begin. I like to break this phase up into three steps:</div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. Create something to talk about</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>My primary objective is to get some ideas on the page as quickly as possible. I'm not worried about it looking beautiful or perfect. I only need it to be good enough to communicate an idea.</p>
        <p>Because this step is all about being creative. It's a time I allow myself to explore and think outside the box. I try to shake things up and get as many different design directions and solutions together as possible.</p>
        <p>I limit the time I allow myself for this step. Typically I give myself one or two 90 minute deep work cycles.</p>
        <p>Then I evaluate the designs. If I'm working on a team I like to explore the designs and talk through the strengths and limitations together. This is a quick conversation.</p>
        <p>Some of the best ideas have come from these conversations. The outcomes is that I either have a clear winner and design direction or I'm still unsure.</p>
        <p>If I'm not sure, I do another round of quick design ideas and re-evaluate.</p>
        <p>Once I have a clear winner I move onto the next step.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. Create the design</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>I wish I could say exactly what should happen here, but the truth is that it depends.</p>
        <p>Each project is different. Sometimes the design is clear enough in my head that I jump directly into creating it with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the design needs to be fleshed out some more. Sometimes it needs a little attention to the details before I'm ready to jump into the code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">3. Add features and use cases</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Now that the primary functionality and design is in place, it's time to move onto additional functionality.</p>
        <p>For example, if I were working on creating an onboarding experience. In the last step I would have worked through and created each of the onboarding steps.</p>
        <p>Now I would work through scenarios where selections weren't made, steps needed to be skipped, or additional functionality like going back to a previous step in the onboarding process.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the design for these features and functionality is clear enough in my head that I can jump right into the code. Other times, a design needs to be done. Typically these designs go very quickly.</p>

<div class="design-step-wrapper">
  <div class="design-step wide-wrapper">
    <div class="design-step--number">Step 3</div>
    <div class="design-step--step">Test & Iterate</div>
    <div class="design-step--description">Remember to use data in order to inform design changes. That‚Äôs what this step is all about:</div>
    <div class="step-process">
      <div class="step-process--title">1. User testing the design </div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>It‚Äôs time to put the design in front of users. In my experience usability testing like this yeilds the most helpful information on the success of this design sprint.</p>
        <p>I typically run user tests in batches of 3-5 users. By then I will have identified where the usability problems are. I redesign the problem areas and re-test until we‚Äôre confident.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">2. Develop Designs</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>Putting pixels to code.  Depending on my role, I‚Äôm not always the one doing it. I love this step, whether I‚Äôm the one writing the code or not. :)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-process--title">3. Validate Design Goals</div>
      <div class="step-process--body">
        <p>In step one we identified goals that would determine success. Now it‚Äôs time to measure those goals. Typically this involves analytics software - hotjar, google analytics, kissmetrics, etc.</p>
        <p>It's important that a regularly scheduled meeting (I find monthly is a good time interval) is set to review the results and to determine actions that need to be taken. Typical actions are re-designing and re-test a certain aspects of the interface, measuring something we missed previously, and so on. I love that all actions are based in data not opinion.</p>
