# Determination And Grit Are More Important Than Talent

![Consistent hard work will make you an expert, not talent.](./images/determination-and-grit.jpg)

Have you ever wanted to be really good at something?

Like _**really**_ good?

I have too.

In fact, right now I'm striving for excellence in a few areas.

However, there's a gap isn't there?

There's a time when you're not good yet. Or maybe you're good but you're not excellent. You're not world class.

And, I don't want to stop until I reach that level.

The problem is that when you see those who are world class, do you ever wonder if you could be as good as them?

Even as I say this I acknowledge that we shouldn't compare oureslves to others. Intellectually I know this. But, it's hard isn't it?

We should only compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, or last week, or last year. We shouldn't compare ourselves to someone on a different journey. They might have simply started a few years earlier and that is what has made the difference for them. You never know.

Comparing yourself to others is not a fair or accurate comparison.

But, we do sometimes, don't we? Even when we know better.

And in those moments, I feel small. I feel like I may never reach their levels. I feel like maybe, just maybe they're a difference species and I can't possibly become what they've become.

But, then I step back and I remember that they are human. They are just like you and me. And if they can do it, I certainly can.

I have the determination and grit to do the work, put in the effort, consistently and patiently <Link to="/blog/why-i-dont-set-goals/">until I become that person</Link>.

And that's my reminder to myself and to you. **Determination and grit are way more important than talent will ever be.**

If you want to reach excellence in a certain area, set your mind to do that thing. Work at it every single day, <Link to="/blog/do-your-best-work">even when you don't want to</Link>.

_**And you will come to see that your consistent hard work is what will make you an expert, not talent.**_

Who you are right now is no indication of who you can become. You choose that.
