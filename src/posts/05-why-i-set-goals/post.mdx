# Why I Set Goals

For most people the whole purpose in setting a goal is to accomplish their goal. Makes sense right?

That's not entirely why I do it. For a long time that was the very reason though.

Don’t get me wrong, I want to accomplish my goals and I will do everything in my power in order to do so.

And when I do reach my goal I find great pleasure and a sense of accomplishment in having done it.

But, that’s no longer the primary reason I set goals.

I discovered that as I was seeking to accomplish my goals, particularly large or difficult goals I was changing into _a different sort of person_ - a better version of myself.

In order to accomplish a difficult goal I had set for myself _**I had to become better**_ in some way in order to complete it.

The best part was once I completed that goal I realized that I could set a harder or more challenging goal the next time because _**I was more capable of achieving it**_.

So, now the primary purpose in setting goals is to _become_ a different, better, more knowledgeable, more skillful person.

I set goals and strive to achieve goals that lead me to become [my desired future self](https://benjaminhardy.com/how-to-become-your-future-self/).

Years ago I read the following passage:

> Let me share with you an intriguing thought. The real value in setting goals is not in their achievement. The acquisition of the things you want is strictly secondary. The major reason for setting goals is to compel you to become the person it takes to achieve them. Let me explain.

> What do you think is the greatest value in becoming a millionaire? Is it the million dollars? I don’t think so. No, the greatest value is in the skills, knowledge, discipline, and leadership qualities you’ll develop in reaching that elevated status. It’s the experience you acquire in planning and developing strategies. It’s the inner strength you’ll develop to have enough courage, commitment, and willpower to attract a million dollars.

> Give a million dollars to someone who doesn’t possess the attitude of a millionaire and that person will most likely lose it. But take away all the wealth from a true millionaire and in no time he or she will build a new fortune. Why? Because they have the knowledge and experience to duplicate the process again and again.

> As you can see, when someone becomes a millionaire, the least important thing is what they have. The most important thing is what they have become.

> - 7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness by John Rohn

This book and this passage in particular has had a huge impact on my life. 

It led me to connect who I wanted to become with my goals today. 

It also made me consider how I could reverse engineer my future self. What knowledge did my future self have that I needed to start developing? 

What skills and experience do I need to start getting in order to become my future self? 

These are the type of questions I began asking myself and thinking about when setting my goals.
