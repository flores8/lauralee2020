# Why I Seek Big Problems

One of the reason I love being a designer is that our designs shape the world.

Doing work that has the potential to change the world is why I am excited to get out of bed in the morning.

I want to work on software that touches lives. Actual people's lives.

I don't think I'm unique in this. I believe most people want to create something meaningful, something that changes the world for the better.

But, unfortunately, most people don’t want to put in the effort it’s going to take to get there.

And the reality is, if we're doing something worthwhile it’s not always going to be easy.

Over ten years ago I listened to a talk that I still love and I still think about. It’s called [What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20/) by Tina Seelig.

One of the lessons she teaches is that no one is going to pay you to solve a non-problem. The bigger the problem the bigger the opportunity.

You and I, we seek for big opportunities and so we should therefore seek to solve big problems. Even if those big problems are not easily solved.
