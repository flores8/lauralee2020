# It's Not Going to Be Easy

One of the reason I love being a designer is that our designs shape the world.

Doing work that has the potential to change the world is why I am excited to get out of bed in the morning.

I want to work on software that touches your life. I want to make your life better because of the work I did.

Doing this level of work is not easy. Work that I sometimes don’t feel like doing.

Everyone wants to create something meaningful, something that changes the world, or at least something that changes someones life for the better.

But, most people don’t want to put in the effort it’s going to take to get there.

And the reality is, if we're doing something worthwhile it’s not going to be easy.

Over ten years ago I listened to a talk that I still love and I still think about. It’s called [What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20/) by Tina Seelig.

One of the lessons she teaches is that no one is going to pay you to solve a non-problem. The bigger the problem the bigger the opportunity. You and I, we seek for big opportunities and so we should therefore seek to solve big problems. But, big problems are not easily solved.

So embrace the difficulty, the challenge, the work that is going to be involved in solving a big problem. Embrace it and don’t give up.

We can't allow ourselves to deliver anything less than our very best work just because it's difficult, or boring, or the last thing that needs to get done before the end of the day.

We need to dig deep, and allow ourselves to stretch and grow when faced with a challenge.

Because, who knows, our work may just make someone's life a little better. And they won't ask how deep you had to dig to do your best work. Or how long it took you.

But maybe, just maybe, our work made your life a little better. And that makes it worth it.
