          I have been designing and creating software for the past decade. I
          absolutely love it. I started my career with a graduate degree in
          Human-Computer Interaction where I was a user researcher and
          eventually ran user research teams. Design is so incredibly integral
          to the user experience. So, I began focusing on product design and UX.
          During this time I learned to code beginning with Ruby on Rails and
          Javascript. In the last few years, all my experience and knowledge has
          culminated to turn my focus to overall product success.

            post, take a look at the image.{" "}

            Colleges and Universities have a lot of laws around Financial Aid.
            At HEC we help them navigate those tricky waters. I am the design

            material, etc. I am also the project manager ensuring each contract
            is within scope, budget, and time. And my favorite role is product
            manager: understanding the market, the players, and discovering
            interesting and innovative solutions to our client's problems.

        <h3>A few of my favorite quotes</h3>

        <p>
          I really love quotes so it's hard to narrow it down but here are a few
          that impact me each time I read them.

        <p className="quote">
          ‚ÄúWe who lived in the concentration camps can remember the men who
          walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last
          piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer
          sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one
          thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any
          given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.‚Äù

          "The secret to winning is learning how to lose. That is, learning to
          bounce back from failure and disappointment‚Äîundeterred‚Äîand continuing
          to steadily march toward your potential. Your response to failure
          determines your capacity for success."
