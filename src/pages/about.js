        <p>I'll never forget the first time I used AI to create an image.</p>
        <p>
          With just a few words describing my vision, I watched as an image
          materialized before my eyes‚Äîsomething uniquely beautiful, generated in
          seconds. In that moment, I realized everything I knew about creative
          work was about to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a product designer with over 15 years of experience, I'd spent my
          career mastering professional creative tools. But this was different.
          This wasn't just another tool‚Äîit was a revolution that would make
          creative expression accessible to everyone, regardless of their
          technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as a Staff Product Designer at Weights & Biases, I have a
          front-row seat to this transformation. Here's what excites me most
          about where we're heading:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>We're breaking creative barriers:</strong> I'm watching AI
              tools help both seasoned designers and complete beginners bring
              their ideas to life. The gap between vision and execution is
              shrinking daily.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Our creative process is evolving: </strong>Every week
              brings new tools that change how we approach design and
              creativity. We're only just scratching the surface!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We're learning together: </strong>The field is moving so
              quickly that everyone, from experts to beginners, is discovering
              and adapting together.
