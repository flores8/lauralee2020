          I’m a Product Designer. I have been very happily working remotely
          since 2008. In 2007 I graduated with a masters degree in
          Human-Computer Interaction. I ran a usability team as well as
          developed and taught courses on user center design and user research
          methods at two different Universities - both in person and online.

          A lot of my work since 2007 has been related to product design. I
          found myself more and more drawn to it. In 2015 I transitioned fully
          to a product design role. I love the symbiotic relationship between
          user research and product design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve found design to be much more than just creating beautiful visuals
          - although that is part of it. Design is understanding the person
          using a product and their goals and helping them be successful. It’s
          also fundamentally about solving business problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, product design is a combination of all three: understanding and
          solving customer and business problems with beautiful visual
          solutions. I absolutely love what I do.

          “Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks.
          But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works.”

          In addition to design, I love to create products. I can create pretty
          much any design in HTML and CSS. I have experience with Javascript and
          Ruby on Rails. I created this website in Gatsby and React. I am
          currently starting a new project called CSS Academy.
